JSON Questions
1. Explain what is CRUD operations and how it is relates to the mongo functions in
the exercise.
CRUD operations stand for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic
functions used to manage data in a database. In this exercise, these operations relate 
directly to MongoDB functions: insertMany was used to create new driver records, find 
to read and display all drivers, updateOne to update a driverâ€™s rating, and deleteOne
to delete unavailable drivers.

2. Identify all the mongo operators used in the exercise, then explain the usage for
each.
The MongoDB operators used in the exercise are $gte and $inc.
 - $gte (greater than or equal to) is used in the query { rating: { $gte: 4.5 } } to filter
and retrieve only the drivers whose rating is 4.5 or higher.
 - $inc (increment) is used in the update operation { $inc: { rating: 0.1 } } to increase the 
rating value of a driver (John Doe) by 0.1.

3. Replace the mongo functions in Task 5 to updateMany instead of updateOne,
compare the diFerence based on the result in console and the mongo compass.
In the console, the updateResult will show that multiple documents were modified while
in MongoDB Compass, you will see that all matching driver documents now have their ratings 
increased, reflecting the batch update instead of a single record change.

4. Replace the mongo functions in Task 6 to deleteMany instead of deleteOne,
compare the diFerence based on the result in console and the mongo compass
In the console, the deleteResult will show a higher deletedCount value if multiple documents were removed 
while in MongoDB Compass, you will see that all drivers meeting the condition are no longer in the collection,
rather than just one record being deleted.
